    <p>Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},</p>

      We are always striving to improve the experience of care at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
      Our records show that you had a recent outpatient clinic visit with your nurse and/or doctor.
      We would like to learn more about your experience in an optional survey. It should take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.
