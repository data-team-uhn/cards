Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},

You are receiving this email because you have recently been discharged from a
University Health Network (UHN) hospital and our records indicate that we sent
you a survey asking about your experience. However we have not heard back from you.

We’d like to hear about your experience while you were an inpatient at UHN.
Your opinions are valuable to us. Your responses will be anonymous and will
be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.

Completing this survey is voluntary. Your responses will not be shared with
the care team and answering will not impact future care you receive at UHN.

The questionnaire contains 13 questions and will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

To begin the survey, click the following link:

If you have any questions or concerns or wish to be removed from the survey,
please contact us at yourexperience@uhn.ca. You can also unsubscribe from all
further emails from Your Experience by following this link:

The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}. Please do not delay.

Thank you for your time and help. Your effort will help us provide better care to
all our patients and ensure it is reflective of UHN’s Patient Declaration of Values
https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/AboutUHN/Quality_Patient_Safety/Pages/patient_values.aspx.

Best regards,
The Patient Experience Team
University Health Network
