    <p>Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},</p>
    <p>
      You are receiving this email because you have recently been discharged from a University Health Network (UHN) hospital
      and our records indicate that we sent you a survey asking about your experience. However we have not heard back from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>We’d like to hear about your experience while you were an inpatient at UHN's Toronto Rehab</strong>. Your opinions are valuable to us.
      Your responses will be anonymous and will be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.

      team and answering will not impact future care you receive at UHN.
    </p>

      The questionnaire contains 17 questions and will take about 10-15 minutes to complete.
    </p>
