    <p>Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your Voice Matters</strong> is a set of questions that gives you the chance to share your cancer care
      experience. Your answers will help us know how to improve the experience for patients and care
      partners at your hospital and across Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell us about your most recent in-person (at the cancer clinic) or virtual (by telephone or video)
      cancer care appointment. It will take <strong>about 5 minutes</strong> to complete this survey.
      This survey is <strong>confidential</strong> (private).
      Your cancer care team will not see your responses to the questions.
      Your answers are combined with other peopleâ€™s responses to help Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario)
      understand how to best support patients.
