Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},

We are always striving to improve the experience of care at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
We would like to learn more about your most recent acute care and inpatient visit at Princess
Margaret. Our records indicate that we sent you an optional survey asking about your experience.
However, we have not heard back from you. This is the last reminder. The survey should take
approximately 5 minutes to complete.

To begin the survey, click the following link:

The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}.

Please note that this survey is compatible with voice activated software which
can be used to navigate it.

The survey will not load if you are using Internet Explorer. Please use another web browser,
such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.

Your contribution is important to improving care. This link is unique to you and should not be
forwarded to others. Your participation is voluntary, and all answers will be kept confidential.
Your care will not be affected in any way. Your responses will not be linked to your name or
personal information, and will be stored separately from your personal health information.

Your answers will be shared only with the Patient and Family Experience Committee and Health Care
Leaders to improve quality.

We have done everything we can to make sure that this survey does not go to families who have
lost a loved one. If you received this survey after your loved one has passed away, please accept
our heartfelt condolences and our sincere apology. You may respond to this survey on behalf of
your loved one if you would like. For all additional patient experience feedback, please email us
at PMExperience@uhn.ca.

Thank you for your time and participation!

Sincerely,
The Patient Experience Team
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, UHN
