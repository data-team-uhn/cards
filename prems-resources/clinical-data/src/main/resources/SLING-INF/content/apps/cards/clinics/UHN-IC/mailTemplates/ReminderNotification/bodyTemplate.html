    <p>Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},</p>
    <p>
      You are receiving this email because you have recently visited a University Health Network (UHN) hospital within the last 30 days
      and our records indicate that we sent you a survey asking about your experience with the Integrated Care Program.
      However we have not heard back from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like you to reflect on your experience with the Integrated Care Program in the last month when you were discharged
      from the hospital and transitioned home, and to provide us with some feedback on supports that you may have received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your opinions are valuable to us.
      Your responses will be anonymous and will be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.

      Completing this survey is voluntary. Your responses will not be shared with the care
      team and answering will not impact future care you receive at UHN.
    </p>
    <p>
      The questionnaire contains 8 questions and will take about 5 minutes to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}. Please do not delay.</strong>
