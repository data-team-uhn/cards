Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},

You are receiving this email because you have recently visited a
University Health Network (UHN) hospital within the last 30 days
and our records indicate that we sent you a survey asking about
your experience with the Integrated Care Program. However we have
not heard back from you.

We would like you to reflect on your experience with the Integrated Care
Program in the last month when you were discharged from the hospital and
transitioned home, and to provide us with some feedback on supports that
you may have received.

Your opinions are valuable to us. Your responses will be anonymous and will
be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.

Completing this survey is voluntary. Your responses will not be shared with
the care team and answering will not impact future care you receive at UHN.

The questionnaire contains 8 questions and will take about 5 minutes to
complete.

To begin the survey, click the following link:

The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}. Please do not delay.

The survey will not load if you are using Internet Explorer. Please use
another web browser, such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.

If you have any questions or concerns or wish to be removed from the survey,
please contact us at Ic_Patientexperience@uhn.ca. You can also unsubscribe from all
further emails from Your Experience by following this link:

Thank you for your time and help. Your effort will help us provide better care to
all our patients and ensure it is reflective of UHNâ€™s Patient Declaration of Values
https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/AboutUHN/Quality_Patient_Safety/Pages/patient_values.aspx.

Best regards,
The Integrated Care Team
University Health Network
