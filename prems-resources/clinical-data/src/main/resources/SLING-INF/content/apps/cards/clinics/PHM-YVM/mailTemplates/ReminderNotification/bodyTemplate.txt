Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},

Your Voice Matters is a set of questions that gives you the chance to share your cancer care
experience. Your answers will help us know how to improve the experience for patients and care
partners at your hospital and across Ontario.

Tell us about your most recent in-person (at the cancer clinic) or virtual (by telephone or video)
cancer care appointment. It will take about 5 minutes to complete this survey. This survey is
confidential (private). Your cancer care team will not see your responses to the questions.
Your answers are combined with other peopleâ€™s responses to help Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario)
understand how to best support patients.

You are receiving this email because you have recently been discharged from a
University Health Network (UHN) hospital.

To begin the survey, click the following link:

The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}.

The survey will not load if you are using Internet Explorer. Please use another web browser,
such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.

If you want to provide detailed feedback about your experience directly to the hospital,
please contact patientexperience@uhn.ca.

If you have any questions or concerns or wish to be removed from the survey,
please contact us at yourexperience@uhn.ca. You can also unsubscribe from all
