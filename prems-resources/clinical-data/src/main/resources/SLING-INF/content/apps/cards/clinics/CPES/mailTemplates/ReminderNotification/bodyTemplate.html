    <p>Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},</p>
    <p>
      You are receiving this email because you have recently been discharged from a University Health Network (UHN) hospital

      <strong>We’d like to hear about your experience while you were an inpatient at UHN</strong>. Your opinions are valuable to us.
      Your responses will be anonymous and will be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.
