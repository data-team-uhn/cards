Dear ${first_name} ${last_name},

You are receiving this email because of your recent visit at a University
Health Network (UHN) hospital within the last 30 days. We’d like to
hear about your experience while you were an inpatient at UHN.
We would also like you to reflect on your experience with
the Integrated Care Program as you transitioned home and to provide us
with some feedback on supports that you may have received, but we have
not heard back from you.

Your opinions are valuable to us. Your responses will be anonymous and will
be used to help UHN continuously improve the quality of care patients receive.

Completing this survey is voluntary. Your responses will not be shared with
the care team and answering will not impact future care you receive at UHN.

The survey consists of two questionnaires containing 20 questions and will
take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

The survey will be available until ${expirationDate}. Please do not delay.

The survey will not load if you are using Internet Explorer. Please use
another web browser, such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.
