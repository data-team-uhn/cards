UHN is updating the way we obtain consent for emailing our patients. UHN may send you health and other information that pertains to you via email, including appointment information, requisitions, and other general information. All electronic communication carries some risk. Please read the information below on the risks of electronic communication and how to protect your privacy:

- Please do not send email to anyone at UHN for urgent symptoms, questions or in an emergency. If you have an urgent medical issue, please call 911 or visit an Emergency Department or Urgent Care Centre.
- Some care areas may send you a follow-up survey after your appointment by email or text. This is to help us to improve the quality of care we deliver. If you receive a link to a survey and are not sure if it is coming from your care team, please call them to check before clicking on any links.
- Other people using the internet may take over electronic communication and introduce malware, phishing scams and may be able to see e-mails sent to or from UHN. Electronic messages are easy to forge, find, copy and forward to others. Electronic messages may exist indefinitely (forever).
- UHN is not responsible for the security of patients' internet service providers, email domains, personal devices, personal computers, applications on those devices, etc. We suggest you take all steps recommended by your various providers to maximize the security of those tools.
- We suggest that you use your personal email when communicating with health care providers such as UHN and not a work email address, as your employer may have the right to inspect your work email.
- Use a secure internet connection. Do not use a public internet connection such as at the airport, internet cafe, public library or other open public area, where it may be easier to "hack" into your email account and access your personal information.
- For more information on how to protect yourself against security risks associated with electronic communication, read this article on UHN.ca: Don't let a phishing attack reel you in. Available at https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/News/Pages/Dont_let_a_phishing_attack_reel_you_in.aspx

Please contact your care provider or the UHN Privacy Office at 416-340-4800 ext. 6937 if you do not wish to receive email communication from UHN. You may withdraw your consent to receive email communication from UHN at any time.
