    # These options can be used to configure the instance.
    # The vbar `|` character separates groups of options,
    # while the comma `,` character separates mutually exclusive options from a group.
    # If one of the options from a group is not specified, then the first one is considered the default and used.
    # If more than one option is specified at runtime, then only the one appearing earlier in this definition list will be used.
    # Install options cannot be changed after the first startup, and they don't need to be specified again for subsequent restarts.

    # oak_tar or oak_mongo define which storage backend to use.
    # For a standalone test instance, the filesystem option oak_tar is quick and easy, since it needs no special setup, but doesn't provide a good enough performance.

    # forms enables the Questionnaires and Forms feature

    # permissions_open lets all authenticated users access all data.
    # permissions_trusted requires that after self-registration, users must be manually added to the TrustedUsers group by an administrator before they can access data.
    # permissions_ownership enforces data ownership and explicit data sharing
